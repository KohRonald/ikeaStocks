# ikeaStocks

## Motivation
Due to COVID-19, there is a global shortage of supplies, including IKEA. I also would wish to upgrade my desk setup but many parts are unavailable. So I decided to create a script to automatically grab the latest stock updates. I also implemented this script into a Telegram bot to check for stocks on the go.
